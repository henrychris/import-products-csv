<p>The iPhone SE features an aluminum frame, paired with a glass front and back. It shares the same physical sizes and dimensions as the<span> </span>iPhone 8, except for a now centered Apple logo and the removal of the iPhone branding in the lower midsection. As a result, phone cases made to fit the iPhone 8 will also fit the iPhone SE.</p>
<p>The iPhone SE is available in three colors: Black, White, and a<span> </span>Product Red<span> </span>edition.<span> </span>Though the offered colors line up with those of the<span> </span>iPhone 8<span> </span>(Silver, Space Gray, and Product Red respectively, with no equivalent to the Gold model), the iPhone SE uses a noticeably deeper shade of black, a brighter shade of white, and a lighter shade of Product Red. Unlike all prior white and silver iPhones from the<span> </span>iPhone 4<span> </span>to the iPhone 8, except for the<span> </span>iPhone 5C, the 2020 iPhone SE features black bezels around the display on all models, matching the color schemes of the<span> </span>iPhone 11<span> </span>and<span> </span>iPhone XR.</p>",Brosphoneparts,Electronics > Communications > Telephony > Mobile & Smart Phones,"","Brand_Apple, Carrier_AT&T, Carrier_Simple Mobile, Carrier_T-Mobile, Carrier_Unlocked, Carrier_Verizon, Color_Red, Device, Hidepreowned, In Stock, iPhone, iPhone SE 2020, iPhone SE 2nd GEN, iPhone SE Series, Model_iPhone SE 2020, SE 2020 Series, Storage (GB)_128GB, Unlocked, waitingforprice",false,Condition,Fair,,,,,,,,T0016S,0.0,shopify,0,deny,manual,0.00,,true,true,MXCY2LL/A,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0573/8142/1079/products/iPhoneSE_2ndGen_PRODUCT_RED1.png?v=1652136035,1,"",false,iPhone SE (2020) (PRODUCT) RED 128GB (Unlocked) - Buy Used & Refurbished - Tradelia Marketplace,"Buy certified refurbished Unlocked 2020 iPhone SE PRODUCT RED 128GB at the best price today.
